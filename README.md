# CSC19
Repository for Children Science Congress projects codes

This repo was made for an Arduino based project called `macro-diy`. The motivation behind `macro-diy` was enlarge the micro-sized technologies to `macro` size which provid e2 benfits
1. Easily Understandable
2. Easy to make without expensive tools

Thus, fulfilling the requirement of making school children interested in *hardware programming*.

Currenty, we have codes of various type of computer inputs (keyboard and mice).

We have 
1. `Light activated keys`
2. `No touch keys (ultra sonic sensor)`
3. `Push button keys`

We use Template Meta Programming to write easily extendable code. 

Raise an issue to report bugs and add new ideas.
